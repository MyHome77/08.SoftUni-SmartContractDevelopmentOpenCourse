# Smart Contract Development With Solidity

The course "Developing smart contracts with Solidity" builds basic skills blockchain development of distributed applications Ethereum environment. The main focus is on building contracts smart (smart contracts), which are implemented in a decentralized network blockchain Ehtereum platform.

Decentralized applications include code that is executed in a decentralized network of blockchain cryptocurrency. Nobody has the power to change the drive or its data and therefore blockchain essence, no one has the ability to do it. This security and guarantee that the application will work exactly as you specified in the code gives us the ability to easily create applications to work with important tasks. Secure voting system, decentralized auction or separate cryptocurrency be implemented in a few lines of code and publish the network in seconds.

Participants must have a sound basic programming skills (working with data, expressions, conditional statements, loops, arrays, lists, associative arrays, classes, methods, and events) because the educational content stepping on them.

As provided blockchain lessons in smart contract development for blockchain network Ethereum The course will cover all the significant moments in the development and publication of a decentralized Ethereum administration: introduction to the language Solidity: its structure, expressions, control structures, data types , types of functions, events, CMO development and publishing applications in the network Ethereum, integration with other software, optimization of performance and security code.

During the course will develop practical projects such as blockchain decentralized DNS, building auction (bidding decentralized), and build their own cryptocurrency.

The course ends with the development and protection of practical project (Ethereum smart contract), which covers studies teaching material and may have a real practical application in blockchain network.

The training covers serious topics of programming and blockchain infrastructure, so we recommend you turn when you have experience with writing code and a solid understanding of the concepts of blockchain technology.
