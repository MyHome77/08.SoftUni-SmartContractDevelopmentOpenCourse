Applying the Emergency Stop pattern to a contract adds a fast and reliable method to halt any sensitive contract functionality, as soon as a bug or another security issue is discovered. This leaves enough time to weigh all options and possibly upgrade the contract in order to fix the security breach.

The negative consequence of having an emergency stop mechanism from a users point of view is, that it adds unpredictable contract behavior. Unless a cogent rule set has to be fulfilled before triggering the stopping mechanism is possible, there is always the possibility that the stop is abused in a malicious way by the authorized entity. Therefore, the emergency stop implemented by this pattern, should only be triggered as a last resort, and not be seen as a pausing mechanism for predictable events. The State Machine pattern with timed transitions can be used for such cases, in order to keep contract behavior predictable for users, and minimize the trust that has to be put into the system.
